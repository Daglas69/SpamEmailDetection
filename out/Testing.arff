2975,'re : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment ) fyi . . . . this change went in for the deal validation group . it gives them the ability to change counterparties names after bridge back . impact to logistics - unify if a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge backed \", it could cause problems on edi pipes as that new counterparty name will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take place . one problem may be with the imbalance data sets \", which are not in production yet . . . . . . ( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths ) this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where nominations were sent for entire month ) can \' t remember the rules on this one \", but i think unify does have some safe guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing . unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers \", yet would still cause an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order to get a clean quick response . what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take place ?

tom \' s words of caution : if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the ability for you to invalidate the deal - and then change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message : \"\" warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure pipeline allows this change . \"\" some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is feedback - i assume for the same reasons we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems ( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new deal and we will have to zero out the old deal . before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just in case it causes problems with their pipeline . sorry - i don \' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask the unify team . there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im market east - but not from ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be the same legal entity . \"\" warning - not the same legal entity \"\" also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals ( transport capacity \", storage \", cash out ) . once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don \' t forget - the items were locked down for a reason . if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down data that was validated - and someone used these deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created using these deals will get corrupted . always check with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in unify . -

sales were brisk \", and if enough of you reserve a copy \", i can get the financing to expand the first printing . let \' s show the world what parrot heads stand for by making this book a big success . when i was on the bhotm tour this summer \", i had many people tell me they wanted to buy an extra book to give to their boss . they wanted the boss to understand why getting the day off for a buffett concert is so important . maybe it will help the rest of us to explain ourselves to our friends \"\" that just don \' t get it . \"\" here \' s one of the latest reviews of the book from bob robinson \", founder & president of the sandlapper phc in south carolina . i had a great time with this club on the \"\" road dawg \"\" tour \", and shared an advance copy with his club : \"\" when we received jackson \' s plea for pictures \", our members were blown away . we hustled up a package of pix \", as did a majority of the parrot head clubs from around the globe \", and the result is pure parrothedonistic pleasure . this collection is bound for glory in the annals of island time . if moderation is your key to life then stay away from jimmydotcom \", \' cause this book is packed with those stories only we can tell . congratulations bubbafreak ! \"\" bobrob sandlapper phc -

( gui display changes only at high level \", not on path ) the scheduler has choice to repath ( if necessary ) \", or not re - path if re - pathing occurs \", the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path unify pushes back the deal number & meter to sitara ( not ctprty info ) balancing works on deal number & meter only ( not ctprty info ) the confirmation desk utilizes the information in sitara ( where all information is correct ) volume management utilizes the information in unify for pipeline tie - out . ( all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match up perfectly ) settlements utilizes information in unify . settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts \", which would create two notification entries if invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty \", re - draft would occur . ( note : there was an issues discovered on reports which it is correcting now ) autonoms \"\" tom \' s words of warning \"\" - previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after deals were pathed and nominated . basically it would change a key on an edi path ( duns number ) not affecting any other of the information already nominated to the pipeline . if the scheduler re - nominated \", data at the pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have no way to correct the problem . in most cases \", the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to manually cut the original nominated volume . this is not an issue with unify ( as explained above ) .

tom \' s words of caution : if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the ability for you to invalidate the deal - and then change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message : \"\" warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure pipeline allows this change . \"\" some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is feedback - i assume for the same reasons we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems ( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new deal and we will have to zero out the old deal . before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just in case it causes problems with their pipeline . sorry - i don \' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask the unify team . there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im market east - but not from ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be the same legal entity . \"\" warning - not the same legal entity \"\" also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals ( transport capacity \", storage \", cash out ) . once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don \' t forget - the items were locked down for a reason . if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down data that was validated - and someone used these deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created using these deals will get corrupted . always check with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in unify . -
